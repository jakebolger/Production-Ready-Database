# Production-Ready-Database
A database was set up and configured for a stockbroker company scenario. The database was stored on a  virtual machine with VMware and Ubuntu. It was created in PostgreSQL. Security, Auditing,  Performance Optimization, and Backup &amp; Recovery were implemented once the database was created to  make it production ready.
